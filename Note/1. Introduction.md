## What is software Architecture?

### First - Get SLA
+ Focus on structure
+ Anticipate expensice choices
+ Core decisions for high quality

It serve for:
+ Maitainability
+ Scalability
+ Reliability
+ Efficiency

There are other restrictions may have:
+ Legal compliance
+ Standards
+ Cost
+ Compentency
+ Time to market
+ Etc

### Second - Priorize them
What is needed first and what can deploy later -> this is important due to time commitment

### Designing the  Architecture
KEEP IN MIND THE STRAGEGIC: `ONE THING AT A TIME`, if think all of the scenarios may happen which lead to overengineera and design some unnecessarily complex system or YAGNI `You Ain't Gonna Need It`.

Need to pick the key architecture for the system:
+ layer
+ event driven
+ Mircoservices
+ ect

Architecture will evoke:
+ Requirements will change.
+ Some changes will be expensive.
+ Balance to avoid over/under engineering.
