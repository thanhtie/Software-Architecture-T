What we need to scale?
+ The data is bigger?
+ The request is inscreasing?
+ The users is increasing?


## Vertical scaling 
-> add more HW into the server -> it so call vertical scaling -> it can help to increase the adaptability but cannot vertical scale to `infinity`, it takes times, cost to maintain the server system.

## Horizontal Scaling
-> Load the request into different server, each server will handle certain amount of request, so that if the request is increase -> only need increase the # of server to adapt. It so called horizontal scaling.

In this type of scaling, it needs a load balancer to distribute the workload for each servers
